# BlackPack
This is a blackjack game called BlackPack. It has a few cool features, including using multiple decks, autoshuffling, and betting. 
	This is my OFFLINE only blackjack game, I am currently developing a version with online functionality.
	It's written in python3 and depends on random only, this is the linux version, it should however run on windows or macos when opened in a python interpreter. 
	It can be installed on linux by placing the file in /usr/bin or any prefered bin folder, and can be ran by calling BlackPack in bash.
